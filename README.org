* CoStricTor Simulator
Go code to simulate the CoStricTor protocol.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go run main.go bloom.go crews.go simulation.go
#+END_SRC

The code is designed to run on the cs high performance cluster, as such you will see references to this in the main.go file

* calculating p or q from epsilon

$$p = \frac{q}{(1-q)e^epsilon + q}$$

$$q = \frac{p e^epsilon}{1-p+pe^epsilon}$$
