Results of the Simulation}
To find appropriate parameters for the protocol, and to analyse the results given by the protocol a simulation was used to test the protocol. The basis of this was the sample implementation of RAPPOR~\cite{IssuesGoogleRappor2017}. This was adapted to our protocol design and rewritten to favour simulation speed. It allows the testing of all system parameters with specific results on our two key metrics: number of sites upgraded by the protocol, and number of sites incorrectly blocked by the protocol. We attempted to run the simulation with various sizes for the number of sites being considered. In for example a simple case, we can consider 500 of the top websites
