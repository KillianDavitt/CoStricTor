* sim 29
does increasing the number of samples allow us to increase p without trashing the results?

did not appear to help, will return to finding good options for the same low p
* sim 30
tried a general sim with the usual p , perfect results, changing threshold does nothing, results are still great

next try: increase p by a tiny bit, 0.000005 instead of 0.000001 my worry is that the program just cannot cope with any noise at all, because like this value is still really tiny, yet its utterly ruining the results. Surely it can't be that bad.
